Assignment #3: Tech Jobs (MVC Edition)
======================================

Introduction
------------

Your first two tasks as an apprentice went well! You, Blake, and Sally built
the TechJobs console prototype and then refactored the code to move it to an
object-oriented format.

After demonstrating the prototype for the Company Team at LaunchCode, it
received the green light to be fully built out as a web application.

.. index:: ! minimum viable product

The first step in this process will be to quickly develop a `minimum viable
product <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product>`__, or MVP. The
goal is to get a functioning web app up and running with as little work as
possible. That way, additional feedback and testing can be done early in the
development process. After that, additional behind-the-scenes work will be
carried out to fully develop the model and data side of the application.

For this next step in the project, you’ll be working with Carly.

Carly was once a LaunchCode apprentice as well, so she knows just what
it’s like to be in your shoes. She’s done some initial work on the
project and left you some ``TODO`` tasks that she knows you can handle.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

In this project, you’ll show that you can:

#. Read and understand code written by others.
#. Work within the controller and view portions of a Spring Boot application.
#. Use Thymeleaf syntax to display data within a view.
#. Create new handler methods to process form submission.

TechJobs (MVC Edition)
----------------------

You’ll start with some code that Carly has provided. The idea behind your
current assignment is to quickly deliver a functioning Spring Boot application,
so you’ll focus on the controllers and views.

In order to do this, you’ll be reusing the ``JobData`` class and
``job_data.csv`` file from the console app. You will eventually have to go back
and rewrite the data portion of the application to make a true, database-backed
model. However, using the existing ``JobData`` class to provide some basic data
functionality lets you focus on the views and controllers for now.

Your Assignment
---------------

The list below provides a general overview of your assigned tasks. Specific
details for each part appear in the following sections, so be sure to read them
carefully as you solve each problem.

#. Review Carly’s code in the ``JobData`` file as well as in the existing
   controllers and views.
#. As her next step, Carly created two basic templates to show lists of jobs
   for each field of the data (``employer``, ``location``, etc.). You will need
   to add some details to these views to allow users to select and display jobs
   stored in the system.
#. Carly started working on the search feature, but only got as far as
   writing the code to display the search form. She’s handed the project to you
   to finish the rest. First, you'll create a controller method to retrieve search results.
#. Finally, you'll display search results in the view. 

Throughout your work, refer to our `demo app <https://java-techjobs-mvc.launchcodetechnicaltraining.org/>`_ as needed to clarify questions about intended application behavior.

Getting Started
----------------

Set up a local copy of the project:

#. In Canvas, **Graded Assignment #3: TechJobs (MVC Edition)** contains a GitHub Classroom assignment invitation link and then set up the project in IntelliJ. Refer back to the GitHub Classroom instructions from :ref:`assignment0` for details. 
#. Launch the application (via the Gradle pane, *Tasks > Application >
   bootRun*) to make sure it starts up properly. Then shut it down.
#. Run the autograding tests. The tests for this assignment are set up the same way as for :ref:`assignment 2 <assignment-2-autograding>`. There are four tasks for this assignment, but the first doesn't require any coding on your part. Therefore, there are 3 tests files (for tasks 2-4). As with assignment 2, we recommend that you only run the tests for the task you are currently working on.


1) Review the Code
-------------------

.. admonition:: Tip

   One essential programming skill that you will develop is the ability to read
   and understand someone else's code. This assignment begins with you
   practicing exactly that. Make sure you carefully examine the provided code
   BEFORE you start changing things.

   Trying to "fix" a code sample before understanding how it works leads to
   confusion, frustration, and a broken program. DO NOT SKIP the code review!

Carly created a Spring Boot application and filled in some features. She
refactored ``JobData`` to generate an ArrayList of ``Job`` objects based on
your TechJobs-OO work, and she added controllers and views for a "Home",
"List", and "Search" page. ``JobData`` now also builds ArrayLists for the
``Employer``, ``Location``, ``PositionType``, and ``CoreCompetency`` objects.

The Model
^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Note

   When referring to Java class locations, we’ll usually omit the leading
   path: ``src/main/java/org/launchcode/``.

The "model" is contained in the ``JobData`` class, which is in the ``models``
package. We put "model" in quotes, since this class isn’t a model in the
typical, MVC/object-oriented sense (maybe a better name for this assignment
would be *TechJobs VC*).

The ``JobData`` class serves the same purpose as before---it reads data from
the ``job_data.csv`` file and stores it in a format we can use. In this case,
that format is an ArrayList of ``Job`` objects. Note that Carly changed the
path to the ``job_data.csv`` file to store it in the ``src/main/resources``
directory.

You’ll use some of the static methods provided by ``JobData`` in your
controller code. Since you’re already familiar with these, we’ll leave it to
you to review their functionality as you go.

The Controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Expand the ``controllers`` package, and you’ll see that you have three
controllers already in place. Let’s look at these one at a time.

The ``HomeController``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class has only one handler method, ``index``, which displays the home page
for the app. The controller renders the ``index.html`` template (in
``src/main/resources/templates``) and provides a fairly simple view.

.. figure:: figures/techJobsMvcHome.png
   :alt: TechJobs MVC home screen.

The ``ListController``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This controller provides functionality for users to see either a table showing
all the options for the different ``Job`` fields (``employer``, ``location``,
``coreCompetency``, and ``positionType``) or a list of details for a selected
set of jobs.

If you look at the corresponding page at ``/list``, you’ll see an "All" column
in the table. However, this option doesn’t work yet, and you will fully
implement that view as you work on the assignment.

At the top of ``ListController`` is a constructor that populates
``columnChoices`` and ``tableChoices`` with values. These HashMaps play the
same role as in the console app, which is to provide a centralized collection
of the different *List* and *Search* options presented throughout the user
interface.

``ListController`` also has ``list`` and ``listJobsByColumnAndValue`` handler
methods, with routes as annotated above their definitions. The first method
renders a view that displays a table of clickable links for the different job
categories. The second method renders a different view that displays
information for the jobs that relate to a selected category. Both of the
handlers obtain data by implementing the ``JobData`` class methods.

In the ``listJobsByColumnAndValue`` method, the controller uses two query
parameters passed in as ``column`` and ``value`` to determine what to fetch
from ``JobData``. In the case of ``"all"`` it will fetch all job data,
otherwise, it will retrieve a smaller set of information. The controller then
renders the ``list-jobs.html`` view. We’ll explore the ``list.html`` and
``list-jobs.html`` templates in a moment.

``listJobsByColumnAndValue`` works similarly to the search functionality, in
that we are "searching" for a particular value within a particular field and
then displaying jobs that match. However, this is slightly different from the
other way of searching in that the user will arrive at this handler method as a
result of clicking on a link within the ``list`` view, rather than via
submitting a form. We’ll see where these links originate when we look at the
views. Also note that the ``listJobsByColumnAndValue`` method deals with an
"all" scenario differently than if a user clicks one of the category links.

The ``SearchController``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the search controller contains only a single method, ``search``.
It simply renders the form defined in the ``search.html`` template.

Later in this assignment, you will receive instructions for adding a second
handler to deal with user input and display the search results.

The Views
^^^^^^^^^

Let’s turn our attention to the views.

The ``fragments`` File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the application is not running, launch it and navigate to the site’s home
page in your browser. Also open up the
``src/main/resources/templates/index.html`` file in IntelliJ. You’ll notice
that there is a fair amount of content visible on the page that isn’t contained
in ``index.html``. This is because we’re using two fragments from
``fragments.html`` (``head`` and ``page-header``). These allow for some basic
page structure and navigation to be shared across all of our views.

Have a look at the structure of ``fragments.html``, but you will NOT need to do
any work within this file for this assignment.

.. admonition:: Tip

   We use `Twitter’s Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__ CSS, HTML, and
   JS framework to provide some styling and functionality to our views. The
   appropriate files are included at the top of ``fragments.html`` and thus
   are included on every page of our app.

   You won’t have to explicitly use Bootstrap at all in this assignment,
   but it’s a great way to make your sites look good with minimal work.
   Consider using it in your own projects!

The List Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turn your attention to ``list.html``. This page displays a table of links
broken down into several categories. Data from ``columnChoices`` is used to
fill in the header row, and information stored in ``tableChoices`` generates
the link text.

The most interesting part of this template is how we generate the links:

.. sourcecode:: html
   :lineno-start: 21

   <td th:each="category : ${tableChoices}">
      <ul>
         <li th:each="item : ${category.value}">
            <a th:href="@{/list/jobs(column=${category.key},value=${item})}" th:text="${item}"></a>
         </li>
      </ul>
   </td>

#. ``tableChoices`` is a HashMap from ``JobData``, and it contains the names of
   the ``Job`` fields as keys (``employer``, etc.). The value for each key is
   an ArrayList of ``Employer``, ``Location``, ``CoreCompetency``, or
   ``PositionType`` objects.
#. In line 21, ``category`` represents one key/value pair from
   ``tableChoices``, and in line 23, ``item`` represents one entry from the
   stored ArrayList.
#. We’ve seen the syntax ``@{/list/jobs}`` to generate a link within a Thymeleaf
   template, but we haven’t seen the other portion of the link:
   ``(column=${category.key},value=${position})``. This syntax causes Thymeleaf
   to dynamically generate query parameters for our URL.

In line 24, we set these parameters by using ``column=`` and ``value=``. The
values of these parameters are determined dynamically based on
``${category.key}`` and ``${item}``. Since these values come from
``tableChoices``, the *keys* will be ``employer``, ``location``, etc. The
*values* will be the individual elements from the related ArrayList. When the
user clicks on these links, they will be routed to the
``listJobsByColumnAndValue`` handler in ``ListController``, which looks for
these parameters.

Clicking on one of the links will display a list of jobs that relate to the
choice, via the ``listJobsByColumnAndValue`` handler method. However, that
view, ``list-jobs.html`` isn’t working yet. While the handler method is fully
implemented, the view template needs some work.

For now, click one of the the *Location* links. This sends a request as we
outlined above, but doing so only displays a page with a title and no job list.

The page you see at ``/list/values?column=location&value=...`` is generated by
the ``list-jobs.html`` template. It has a similar structure as ``list.html``,
but the table consists of only one column.

.. admonition:: Note

   Select "Kansas City" from the list of locations, and then check the address
   bar of your browser:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      /list/jobs?column=location&value=Kansas%20City

   Thymeleaf inserts ``%20`` for us, to represent a space, but this may
   actually be hidden in your browser’s address bar.

The Search View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, click on *Search* from the home page, or the navigation bar, and open
up ``search.html`` in IntelliJ. You’ll see a search form (in both the browser
and template file) that gives the user the option of searching by a given
``Job`` field, or across all fields. This is an exact visual analog of our
console application.

This template will be used to display search results, in addition to rendering
the form. This will give the nice user experience of easily searching multiple
times in a row.

Wrap Up the Code Review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you understand the controllers and views that are already in place, you’re
ready to begin your work.

In IntelliJ, select *View > Tool Windows > TODO* to pop open a small pane at
the bottom of the window. This list is populated by any code comments that
start with ``TODO``. You’ll see your tasks listed, and clicking on any one will
open the relevant file.

.. figure:: figures/techJobsTodos.png
   :alt: TechJobs MVC TODO list.

As you work on your tasks, refer to the
`demo app <https://lc-java-3-demo.herokuapp.com/>`__.

2) Complete the List Views
---------------------------

Open the ``list-jobs.html`` template. Currently, the page just establishes the
navigation bar and page title. You need to add code that will present relevant
job information.

Display List of Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page needs to show full job listings---ID, employer, location, etc.

#. In ``list-jobs.html``, create a loop to display each job passed in from the
   controller. The job data should be presented in *tables*, with each job in its own table. Be sure to check in ``ListController`` to find the variable names available to the template.
#. Adding the CSS class ``"job-listing"`` to a table provides some nice
   styling, courtesy of Carly’s work!
#. Construct a table for each job, with
   one job field per row.

   .. figure:: figures/job-listing-tables.png
      :alt: Job listings, one per table
      :scale: 70%

#. Be sure to test your code by running the program and clicking links from
   different categories on the ``/list`` page.

   a. Clicking the *Web - Back End* link yields 6 jobs.
   b. *iOS* yields 4 jobs.
   c. *New York* yields 1 job.
   d. Etc.

Add ``View All`` Link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the ``list.html`` template. This file builds the table to display all of
the links for the different ``Job`` fields. However, the link for the ``All``
column is missing.

.. figure:: figures/listTableOptions.png
   :alt: Image of the ``/list`` table.

You can fix this several different ways, but two options are presented below.
Note that you only need to implement ONE option, not both.

#. Modify ``tableChoices`` in ``ListController`` to include another key/value
   pair. Check the method that renders the template to help identify the name
   to use for the key.
#. Modify ``list.html`` to fill in the empty table cell with the necessary
   link. Check ``ListController`` to help identify the data to pass in for the
   query parameters.

Be sure to test your code by clicking your new *View All* link in the table.
There are 98 jobs in the data file.

3) Complete ``SearchController``
-------------------------------------

Add a ``displaySearchResults`` handler method to ``SearchController``:

#. Use the correct annotation for the method. To configure the correct mapping
   type and mapping route, refer to the ``form`` tag in the ``search.html``
   template. (Use ``@GetMapping`` or ``@PostMapping`` rather than ``@RequestMapping``.)
#. The ``displaySearchResults`` method should take in a ``Model`` parameter.
#. The method should also take in two other parameters, specifying the type of
   search and the search term.
#. In order for these last two parameters to be properly passed in by Spring
   Boot, you need to use the correct annotation. Also, you need to name them
   appropriately, based on the corresponding form field names defined in
   ``search.html``.
#. If the user enters "all" in the search box, or if they leave the box empty,
   call the ``findAll()`` method from ``JobData``. Otherwise, send the search
   information to ``findByColumnAndValue``. In either case, store
   the results in a ``jobs`` ArrayList.
#. Pass ``jobs`` into the ``search.html`` view via the ``model`` parameter.
#. Pass ``ListController.columnChoices`` into the view, as the existing
   ``search`` handler does.

4) Display Search Results
-------------------------

Once you have your ``displaySearchResults`` handler passing information to the
view, you need to display the data.

#. In ``search.html``, create a loop to display each job passed in from the
   controller.
#. Put the job results into a set of tables, similar to what you did for the
   ``list-jobs`` view.

.. admonition:: Tip

   You can *reuse* the code you just wrote in ``list-jobs.html`` by defining a
   new *fragment* in that file. Then you need to include that fragment in
   ``search.html``.

   For the fragment to work properly in both files, the variables passed in by
   ``model.addAttribute()`` must use the same names.

Sanity Check
-------------

At this point, all autograding tests should be passing. To be sure, right-click on the ``org.launchcode.techjobs.mvc`` package in ``src/test/java`` and select *Run tests in...* If any test fails, evaluate the failure/error message and go back to fix your code.

You might also want to check your app's behavior against that of `our demo app <https://quiet-ravine-03237.herokuapp.com/>`_.

How to Submit
--------------

To turn in your assignment and get credit, follow the
:ref:`submission instructions <submitting-your-work>`.

Bonus Missions
--------------

Here are some additional challenges, for those willing to take them on:

#. When we select a given field to search within and then submit, our choice is
   forgotten and returns to "All" by default. Modify the view template to keep
   the previous search field selected when displaying the results.
#. In the tables displaying the full job data, find a way to manipulate the
   font, style, capitalization, etc. to further distinguish the labels from the
   data (e.g. **Employer:** *LaunchCode*). (*Hint:* We capitalize the title
   string in multiple templates, so have a look around).
#. In the tables of the job results, make each value (except ``name``)
   hyperlinked to a new listing of all jobs with that same value. For example,
   if we have a list of jobs with the ``JavaScript`` skill, clicking on a
   location value like ``Saint Louis`` will generate a new list with all the
   jobs available in that city.

Super Bonus Mission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a big one! Prepare for a challenge!

Notice that we went to the trouble of passing in the ``actionChoices``
HashMap to the view in the ``HomeController.index`` method. This puts the
responsibility of which actions should be presented on the controller, and not
the view. However, we didn’t go to such lengths for the navigation links
displayed on every page of the site.

In order to make the navigation links similarly detached, we’d need to pass
``actionChoices`` in to *every* view, since the nav links are generated in
``fragments.html``. We’d have to do something like the line below in every
handler method, which would be a pain, not to mention error-prone and difficult
to update.

.. sourcecode:: java

   model.addAttribute("actions", actionChoices);

Let’s fix this.

#. Make a new controller, ``TechJobsController``. This new controller should
   have a static HashMap, ``actionChoices``. The HashMap should be populated
   via a no-argument constructor, just like ``columnChoices`` is
   populated in ``ListController``. You do NOT need to add the ``@Controller``
   annotation to this class.
#. Write a static method ``getActionChoices`` in ``TechJobsController`` that
   returns the ``actions`` HashMap.
#. Add the annotation ``@ModelAttribute("actions")`` to this method. This
   annotation will cause the return value of the method to be set in the model
   with key ``"actions"`` for every controller that extends
   ``TechJobsController``.
#. Modify every one of your other controllers to extend ``TechJobsController``.
#. Modify ``fragments.html`` to use the passed-in action choices to generate
   the navigation links.
#. Finally, update your code so that ``columnChoices`` also lives in
   ``TechJobsController``.
