Studio: Fun with Quizzes
========================

For this studio, you will design and build a console program that allows
the user to take a quiz. This means you will have to create some
questions, and get some input from the user.

First, the questions. We want to be able to handle multiple types of
questions:

#. **Multiple choice**: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which only one may be chosen and only one answer is correct
#. **Checkbox**: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which any number may be chosen; there is one correct combination of choices
#. **True/False**: a question that has a true/false answer

Design
------

In order to design your program, consider:

#. What do these types of questions have in common?
#. What makes these question types different?

First, design a base class (called ``Question``) that contains the common features, and
design subclasses for each of the question types. For each question type
be sure to include: 

#. Class name
#. Fields and properties with access modifiers
#. Methods with access modifiers
#. Any inheritance relationship

Should any of the question classes be abstract? If so, should any of its
methods be abstract?

Make sure that there is functionality included to display the questions,
to display the possible answers, and to check to see if the answer(s) is
correct.

Then design the ``Quiz`` class. A quiz has a list of questions, and we
should be able to: 

#. Add questions
#. Run or carry out the quiz
#. Grade the quiz

Implementation
--------------

Create a new IntelliJ project and implement the design that you created.
If you are unsure about your design, get some feedback by talking through it with a classmate before you start coding.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Create a class named ``QuizRunner`` with only a ``main`` method. The program should
create several questions, present them to the user, accept the userâ€™s
responses, and then tell them whether their answers were correct or
incorrect.

How to Submit
-------------

Push up your work to a new Github repository. Submit the link to your repository in the Lesson 6 Studio assignment in Canvas.

Bonus Missions
--------------

#. Add a short answer question type that includes validation behavior to
   only allow the user to enter text with less than 80 characters.
#. Add a couple of more question types to your program:

   #. Linear scale: a question that allows the user to provide a numeric
      response within an integer scale, which may vary from question to
      question. For instance, it could be 1-3 for one linear scale
      question, and 1-5 for another.
   #. Paragraph: Similar to short answer but allows for responses of up
      to 500 characters.
#. Add tests with JUnit to your classes.
