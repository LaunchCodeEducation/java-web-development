Class Diagrams
==============

We have mentioned a few times the importance of designing your classes
before starting to write code. It’s important to think about the fields,
properties, and methods of your classes, as well as the relationship of your
various classes to each other. Doing so will not only result in better
code, but will also mean that you’re less likely to have to rewrite your
code due to lack of foresight.

**Class diagrams** are informal tools for sketching out class design.
They are often discussed in the context of the `Unified Modeling
Language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language>`__,
but most programmers use them much less formally. This will be our
approach as well.

We’ll introduce you to a few accepted conventions used when drawing
class diagrams. These guidelines are by no means comprehensive, and they
should not be thought of as rigid rules. There’s
no compiler to yell at you for not drawing a class diagram properly!
Instead, we encourage you to use class diagrams as planning and
communication tools. Use whichever of the conventions you choose, based 
on your needs.

Class diagrams can be created within some IDEs (including IntelliJ) and
with specialized software. However, most of the time you’ll be drawing
them by hand, so that’s what we’ll do here.

Diagramming a Single Class
--------------------------

In diagramming a single class, we create a box and divide it into three
sections: 

#. **Top**: Class name 
#. **Middle**: Fields 
#. **Bottom**: Methods

   A basic class diagram.

For fields, we can specify additional useful information, such as access
level and data type. For methods, we can similarly specify access level,
return type, and input parameter types. We will often use “**+**” as
shorthand for public, and “**-**” as shorthand for private. If we want
to indicate that some methods or fields are omitted, we can use ellipses
“**…**”.

Diagramming Class Relationships
-------------------------------

What’s even more useful than just diagramming a single class is
diagramming the relationships between the classes within our programs.

Suppose we are designing a program to track students and the classes
that they have taken. We might think about three classes: 

#. ``Student``: Represents an individual student 
#. ``Transcript``: Represents a student’s transcript, including 
   classes that they have taken 
#. ``CourseRecord``: Represents an individual course that a student 
   has completed, along with the grade achieved.

We can represent these three classes and their relationships to each
other in the following diagram:

.. figure:: figures/relationships.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Relationship class diagram.

   Relationship class diagram.

Since, in this situation, we’re only concerned with their  relationships, 
we’ve omitted the fields and methods of these classes. The lines between
each are different, and convey different information.

A plain, solid line between two classes indicates a **one-to-one
relationship**. For each ``Student``, there is one ``Transcript``, and a
``Transcript`` can be owned by only one ``Student``.

A line with an open diamond on the end indicates a **one-to-many
relationship**. Each ``Transcript`` has many ``CourseRecord`` objects.

Another type of relationship that we have recently encountered is the
*is-a* relationship of inheritance. This can be expressed via a class
diagram by using an arrow, directed from the subclass to the base class.

   :alt: Inheritance class diagram.

There are many more ways to express relationships in class diagrams, and
you’ll even see slight variations in usage of lines and the decorators 
used to specify the type of relationship.

For most purposes, your main concern should be visually communicating
information about your program design. To that end, if you are going to
share your diagram with somebody else, it is always helpful to use a key
to indicate the specific meaning you have attached to each symbol used.

.. admonition:: Question

   With pen and paper, write a class diagram that depicts the relationship
   between a class ``Rocket``, that extends a ``SpaceCraft`` and has a 
   ``LaunchPad`` and several ``Engine`` objects. Include some fields and methods.

   True/False: You drew a class diagram by hand.

   #. True
   #. False

.. ans: true :)

.. admonition:: Question

   True/False: When making class diagrams, the main idea is to get the
   design rules just right so that you won't need to update your classes
   in the future.

   #. True
   #. False

.. ans: false --- the drawing conventions are less important than the exercise
                  of making the diagrams :)
