Inheritance in OOP
==================

.. index:: ! inheritance, ! subtyping

**Inheritance** is the second of the **Four Pillars of Object-Oriented
Programming** that we encounter.

Hereâ€™s a definition: inheritance is a mechanism within object-oriented programming that
allows one class to be based on another class, thus receiving its
properties and behaviors. 

.. note::

   Inheritance is also sometimes referred to as **subtyping**.
