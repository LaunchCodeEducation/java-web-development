Exercises: Interfaces and Polymorphism
======================================

As a new Java coder, it might take you some time to recognize the usefulness of
interfaces. At first glance, these tools do not seem to provide much benefit
over extending a base class, adding instance methods to a class, or overriding
a method like ``toString``.

To help overcome this, let's consider a common occurrence---sorting an
``ArrayList`` of objects.

#. If the list contains ``String`` or numerical entries, then sorting the list
   is :ref:`trivial <arraylist-methods>`:

   .. sourcecode:: java

      Collections.sort(arrayListName);

#. However, if the elements are custom objects (like ``Cat``), then sorting the
   list becomes more complicated. This is because the objects may contain
   multiple fields, any of which could be used as a sorting option. For
   ``Cat`` objects, this could include ``name``, ``age``, or ``mass``.

Getting Started
---------------

Work on these exercises in the IntelliJ ``java-web-dev-exercises`` project.
You will find the starter code in the ``lsn7interfaces`` package. Go ahead and
open the folder and take a quick look at the class files.

You will practice implementing interfaces by playing around with a small ice
cream store. It consists of a refrigerated display ``Case``, which contains
a collection of ice cream ``Flavor`` objects and a selection of ``Cone``
objects.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Did you notice the abstract ``Ingredient`` class? This gets extended into
   ``Flavor`` and ``Cone`` to help streamline the code.

Sorting Flavors by Name
------------------------

To display a menu for your customers, you need to sort the ice cream flavors
alphabetically by their ``name`` field. Fortunately, the ``Comparator``
interface helps you solve the sorting-objects-by-field problem.

Create a Sorting Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a new class called ``FlavorComparator`` and have it implement the
   ``Comparator`` interface:

   .. sourcecode:: java

      public class FlavorComparator implements Comparator<Flavor>

#. Notice that IntelliJ flags a couple of errors that you need to fix:

   a. Import ``java.util.Comparator``. This removes the flag on ``Comparator``.
   b. Hover over the line again and select *implement methods*. Choose the
      ``compare`` option.

      .. figure:: figures/implement-methods.png
         :alt: Selection menu for methods to implement.

   c. This adds an ``@Override`` method that compares two ``Flavor`` objects
      and *always* returns ``0``.

      .. sourcecode:: java
         :lineno-start: 6

         @Override
         public int compare(Flavor o1, Flavor o2) {
            return 0;
         }

#. Always returning ``0`` results in no sorting, so replace line 8 with:

   .. sourcecode:: java

      return o1.getName().compareTo(o2.getName());

   This returns an integer (negative, positive, or zero) depending on
   whether ``Flavor`` object ``o1`` or ``o2`` comes first, alphabetically.

Sorting the ``flavors`` ArrayList
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``Main``, we declare ``menu`` that contains everything in the ``Case``
as well as specific ``flavors`` and ``cones`` collections.

.. sourcecode:: java
   :lineno-start: 6

   public static void main(String[] args){
      Case menu = new Case();
      ArrayList<Flavor> flavors = menu.getFlavors();
      ArrayList<Cone> cones = menu.getCones();

   }

#. To sort the ``flavors`` list, first create a new ``FlavorComparator``
   object.

   .. sourcecode:: java
      :lineno-start: 6

      public static void main(String[] args){
         Case menu = new Case();
         ArrayList<Flavor> flavors = menu.getFlavors();
         ArrayList<Cone> cones = menu.getCones();
         Comparator comparator = new FlavorComparator();
      }

#. Next, call the ``sort`` method on ``flavors`` and pass the ``comparator``
   object as the argument.

   .. sourcecode:: java
      :lineno-start: 6

      public static void main(String[] args){
         Case menu = new Case();
         ArrayList<Flavor> flavors = menu.getFlavors();
         ArrayList<Cone> cones = menu.getCones();
         Comparator comparator = new FlavorComparator();

         flavors.sort(comparator);
      }

#. Iterating through the ``flavors`` list before and after the sort shows
   the results. (The output below displays just the ``name`` fields).

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Before:                 After:

      Vanilla                 Chocolate
      Chocolate               Red Velvet
      Red Velvet              Rocky Road
      Rocky Road              Strawberry Sorbet
      Strawberry Sorbet       Vanilla

Note that ``Main`` does NOT have to implement the ``Comparator`` interface.
This only needs to happen in the class that actually uses the ``compare``
method.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Instead of declaring and initializing the ``comparator`` object, we could
   combine steps 1 and 2 by using a single statement:

   .. sourcecode:: java

      flavors.sort(new FlavorComparator());

Sorting Cones by Cost
----------------------

Now let's sort our ``cones`` list by cost, from least expensive to most
expensive.

#. Create the new class ``ConeComparator``.
#. Follow the example above to implement the ``Comparator`` interface and
   evaluate ``Cone`` objects by cost.
#. In ``Main``, sort the ``cones`` list, then print the elements to the screen
   to verify the results.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Before:           After:

      Waffle: $1.25        Bowl: $0.05
      Sugar: $0.75         Wafer: $0.50
      Wafer: $0.50         Sugar: $0.75
      Bowl: $0.05          Waffle: $1.25

:ref:`Check your solution <interfaces-and-polymorphism-exercise-solutions3>`

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Did you get this error?

.. figure:: figures/compare-double.png
   :alt: ``compare`` must return ``int``.

This happens because according to the interface, ``compare`` MUST return an
integer value, but the ``cost`` fields are ``double`` type.

To fix this, use an ``if/else if/else`` block to evaluate
``o1.getCost() - o2.getCost()``. Return a positive integer, negative integer,
or 0 depending on the result.

Bonus Exercises
----------------

#. Modify ``FlavorComparator`` to sort ``Flavor`` objects by the number of
   allergens, from highest to lowest.
#. Create a ``Topping`` class that extends ``Ingredient``. Add toppings
   to the ``Case`` constructor, then choose how to sort a ``toppings`` array
   in ``Main``.

Next Steps
-----------

In these exercises, you practiced implementing existing interfaces. In the
studio activity, you will design and implement your own.
