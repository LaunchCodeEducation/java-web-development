Thymeleaf Forms
===============

Templates allow you to build generic forms. This lets you reuse the structure
by rendering the same template with different labels and data. Thus, a single
form can serve different purposes, saving you extra effort.

Whenever possible, reuse existing templates!

Start a New Project
--------------------

You will build a new project so you can practice with templates and forms.
If you have not done so, commit and push any unsaved work from your
``hello-spring`` project.

Your new project will keep track of some fictional coding events.

#. Use the `start.spring.io <https://start.spring.io/>`__ website to initialize
   your new project.
#. Follow the steps you used to setup
   :ref:`hello-spring <initialize-spring-boot-project>`, but call the new
   project ``coding-events``.
#. Add the *Thymeleaf* dependency in addition to *Spring Web*, *Spring Boot DevTools*, and
   *Validation*.
#. *Generate* the ``.zip`` file and then import it into IntelliJ.

Coding Events Setup - Video
---------------------------

Now that you have ``coding-events`` up and running, add features to it by
coding along with the videos below:

.. youtube::
   :video_id: hmgxMOf51JU

.. admonition:: Note 

   This video demonstrates the features we've added to a new MVC application we'll be working with called ``coding-events``. 
   
   The code 
   presented in this video is found on the
   `starter branch of coding-events-demo <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/coding-events/tree/starter>`__. 
   
   You should create your own version of ``coding-events`` from `Spring Initializer <https://start.spring.io/>`__ and refer to the video and this branch
   to replicate our code. You may fork and clone from the ``coding-events-demo`` project for reference.

Coding Events Setup - Text
--------------------------

The code reviewed in the video uses concepts learned in the :ref:`previous chapter <controllers>` to set up a controller and a couple of views. If you need to review any of these concepts, go back to that chapter. 

#. Create a ``controllers`` package.
#. Within the new package, create a new controller class named ``HomeController``. Annotate the class with ``@Controller``.
#. Add a single ``GET`` handler method that returns the name templated ``index``, which will be the name of the template we create in the next step.
#. Create a new Thymeleaf template named ``index.html`` in the ``src/main/resources/templates`` directory. This template could contain a single link to ``/events``.
#. In the controllers package, create a new controller named ``EventController``. Annotate the class with ``@Controller`` and ``@RequestMapping("events")``.
#. In the new controller, create a handler method for ``GET`` requests that takes a single parameter, ``Model model``. 
#. Within the handler, create an empty list and add a few event names to it.
#. Add the list to the model by calling ``model.addAttribute("events", events)``. Then return the template name ``"events/index"``.
#. Within the ``src/main/resources/templates`` directory, create a new directory named ``events``. Within this directory, create a new Thymeleaf template named ``index.html``.
#. Within the new template, loop over the ``events`` object and display the name of each event.

Create and Render a Form - Video

   The starter code for this video is found at the `starter branch <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/coding-events/tree/starter>`__. of the ``coding-events-demo`` repo. 
   The final code presented in this video is found on the `form branch <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/coding-events/tree/form>`__. As always, code along to the 
   videos on your own ``coding-events`` project.

Before moving on, be sure to commit and push your changes. Do this after each
video to create a fallback position just in case disaster strikes your project
in the future.

A summary of Thymeleaf forms is given below, but remember that the text
supports the videos and is NOT intended as a replacement.

Create and Render a Form - Text
-------------------------------

A Thymeleaf form is simply a template that includes a ``<form>`` element inside
the ``body`` of the HTML. The method for the form should be of type ``post``.

.. sourcecode:: HTML
   :linenos:

   <body>

      <!-- Other HTML -->

      <form method="post">
         <input type="text" name="inputName">
         <input type="submit" value="submitButtonText">
      </form>

      <!-- Other HTML -->

   </body>

You can include as many inputs as you need in the form, and these can be of
different types (e.g. text, email, checkbox, etc.). However, each different
piece of data you want to collect needs to have a unique ``name`` attribute.

To *render* the form in the view, add a method to the controller using the
``@GetMapping`` annotation:

.. sourcecode:: java
   :linenos:

   @GetMapping("formTemplateName")
   public String renderFormMethodName(Model model) {

      // Method code...

      return "pathToTemplate";
   }

Some points to note:

#. Line 1: The string parameter for ``GetMapping`` must be the name of the form
   template you want to use.
#. Line 2: Declare a ``Model`` object to hold data that needs to be passed to
   the template.
#. The method code performs any data manipulation required before rendering the
   form. The ``model.addAttribute`` statements would be included here.
#. The ``return`` string specifies the path to the template. Recall that Spring
   automatically adds MOST of the file path---up through ``.../templates``. You
   need to add any path details that follow.

   a. For example, if our ``templates`` folder contains a subfolder called
      ``events`` that holds a template called ``create.html``, then line 6
      would be ``return "events/create";``.

Add a Form Handler Method - Video
---------------------------------

Now that you have created and rendered a form in your ``coding-events``
project, you need to add a method to the controller to *handle* its submission.
Code along with the video below to add this functionality.

.. youtube::
   :video_id: LnpJcq33uoM
   
.. admonition:: Note 

   The starter code for this video is found at the `form branch <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/coding-events/tree/form>`__. of the ``coding-events-demo`` repo. 
   The final code presented in this video is found on the `form2 branch <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/coding-events/tree/form2>`__. As always, code along to the 
   videos on your own ``coding-events`` project.

As usual, the following summary outlines the ideas from the clip.

Add a Form Handler Method - Text
--------------------------------

To *process* a form after the user clicks the *Submit* button, you need to add
a method to the controller using the ``@PostMapping`` annotation:

.. sourcecode:: java
   :linenos:

   @PostMapping("formTemplateName")
   public String processFormMethodName(@RequestParam Type parameter1, Type parameter2, ...) {

      // Method code...

      return "redirect:templateName";
   }

Some points to note:

#. Line 1: The string parameter for ``PostMapping`` must be the name of the
   form template.
#. Line 2: For each piece of data that needs to be retrieved from the form,
   declare a parameter of the appropriate type.

   .. admonition:: Note

      ``@RequestParam`` matches the parameters to the submitted data. For this
      to work, the parameter names MUST match the ``name`` attributes used in
      each of the ``input`` elements.

#. The method code performs any data manipulation required after the
   information gets submitted.
#. Line 6: Generally, we want to send the user to a different page after they
   successfully submit a form. Instead of re-rendering the form, the ``return``
   string *redirects* the user to a method that handles a different template.
